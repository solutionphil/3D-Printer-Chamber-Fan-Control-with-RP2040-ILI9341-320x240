## TFT_eSPI Folder

These files need to be copied to your Arduino working folder to ensure RP2040 / ILI9341 compatibility. You can find them typically located at:
```
C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI\ 
```
**Note:**
Alternatively, you can rename the file to `User_Setup.h` and copy it into the folder. However, be aware that your settings may be lost during a library update.
